00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,240
Welcome

00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:00,280

00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:00,800
another

9
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,600
Emily

10
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,240
felt

11
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:04,960
bashful

12
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:05,320
when

13
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:05,360
the

14
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:06,040
spotlight

15
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:06,360
turned

16
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:06,400
to

17
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:06,400
her

18
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:06,400
during

19
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:06,400
the

20
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,300
party.

21
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:07,400
Her

22
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:07,800
cheeks

23
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:08,240
turned

24
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:08,480
pink,

25
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:08,560
and

26
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:08,880
she

27
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:09,440
looked

28
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,040
down,

29
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:10,600
shyly

30
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:10,920
avoiding

31
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:11,080
eye

32
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,100
contact.

33
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:12,120


34
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:12,640
So,

35
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:12,840
what

36
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:13,280
does

37
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:13,840
'bashful'

38
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:14,320
mean?

39
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:14,600
It's

40
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:14,760
an

41
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:15,360
adjective,

42
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:15,520
and

43
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:15,560
it

44
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,200
describes

45
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:16,400
being

46
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:16,920
shy

47
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:16,920
or

48
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:17,560
timid,

49
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:17,760
often

50
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:17,800
in

51
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:17,880
a

52
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:18,160
way

53
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:18,200
that

54
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:18,560
is

55
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,600
endearing.

56
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:19,760
It's

57
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:20,320
pronounced

58
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,160
'BASHFUL'.

59
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:21,680


60
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:21,840
Let's

61
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,200
see

62
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:22,360
it

63
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:22,360
in

64
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:22,520

65
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:22,760

00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:22,760
a

67
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:22,960
couple

68
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:23,160

71
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:24,960
She

72
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:25,360
became

73
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:25,880
bashful

74
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:26,080
when

75
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:26,400

78
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:27,160

80
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,840
2)

81
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,040
The

82
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:29,440
bashful

83
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:29,880
student

84
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,480
hesitated

85
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:30,480
to

86
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:30,720
speak

class.

92
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,000


93
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,920
Now,
