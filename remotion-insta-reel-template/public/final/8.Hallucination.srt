00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:02,240


7
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:02,560
Under

00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:03,040

00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:07,520
weren't

20
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,320
real.

21
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,200
Hallucinations

22
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:09,320
can

23
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:09,520
be

24
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:10,120
unsettling,

25
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:10,200
as

26
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:10,360
they

27
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:10,640
create

28
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,360
perceptions

29
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:11,720

32
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,360
often

33
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:13,680
affecting

00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,120

00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:15,560


39
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,000
So,

40
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,160
what

41
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:16,480

00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,480
'hallucination'

43
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,200
mean?

44
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:18,320
It's

45
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:18,400
a

46
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:18,840
noun,

47
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:19,480
referring

48
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:19,480

59
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:23,320
Itâ€™s

60
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,160
pronounced

61
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,000
HALLUCINATION.

62
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,320

74
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:30,520
