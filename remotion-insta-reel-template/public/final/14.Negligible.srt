00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,360
Welcome

2
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:00,600
to

3
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:00,880
'Daily

4
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:02,060
Word'!

6
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:02,100
The

7
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:02,440
impact

8
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:02,480
of

9
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:02,720
the

10
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:03,080
small

11
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:03,320
pebble

12
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:03,600
on

13
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:03,760
the

14
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:04,080
giant

15
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:04,360
mountain

16
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:04,600
was

17
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:05,580
negligible.

18
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:05,680
It

19
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:05,780
hardly

20
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:06,160
made

21
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:06,400
a

22
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,200
difference,

23
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:07,320
like

24
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:07,480
a

25
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:07,680
whisper

26
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:07,720
in

27
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:07,960
a

28
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:09,000
storm.

30
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,160
So,

31
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:09,360
what

32
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:09,520
does

33
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:10,040
'negligible'

34
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,080
mean?

35
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:11,320
It's

36
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:11,600
an

37
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:11,880
adjective,

38
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:12,280
and

39
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:12,480
it's

40
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:12,800
all

41
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,200
about

42
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:13,440
something

43
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:13,640
being

44
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:14,040
so

45
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:14,480
small

46
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:14,720
or

47
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,040
unimportant

48
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:15,120
that

49
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:15,240
it

50
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:15,440
can

51
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:15,680
be

52
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,200
ignored

53
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:16,320
or

54
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,080
disregarded.

55
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:17,920
Pronounced

56
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,080
as

57
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,480
'NEGLIGIBLE'

58
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:19,480


59
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:19,840
Now,

60
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:20,120
let's

61
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:20,520
explore

62
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:20,760
some

63
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:21,720
examples:

64
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,280
1)

65
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:22,400
The

66
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:22,760
cost

67
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,160
difference

68
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:23,280
was

69
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,120
negligible,

70
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:24,360
so

71
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:24,400
I

72
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:24,560
bought

73
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:24,680
the

74
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:24,960
cheaper

75
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:25,840
option.

76
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,480
2)

77
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:26,480
The

78
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,640
errors

79
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:27,640
in

80
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:27,880
the

81
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:28,200
document

82
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:28,560
were

83
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,160
negligible

84
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:29,320
and

85
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:29,720
didn't

86
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:29,880
affect

87
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,520
understanding.

88
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,280
3)

89
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:32,400
In

90
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,080

91
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,080

92
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:34,680
researchers

93
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,000
strive

94
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,280

95
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:35,480

97
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,280
margin

98
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:36,400
of

99
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:36,860
error.

101
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:37,830
Can

102
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:37,880
