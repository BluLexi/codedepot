1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,160
At

2
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:00,280
the

3
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:00,560
park,

4
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:00,720
I

5
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:01,080
found

6
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:01,080
a

7
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:01,520
lonely

8
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:02,200
puppy.

9
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:02,260
It

10
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:02,400
looked

11
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:02,920
sad,

12
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:03,040
like

13
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:03,520
someone

14
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:03,560
had

15
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:04,080
abandoned

16
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:04,720
it.

17
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:04,840
I

18
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:05,120
decided

19
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:05,240
to

20
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:05,400
take

21
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:05,440
it

22
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:05,800
home

23
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:05,920
and

24
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:06,000
give

25
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,040
it

26
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:06,280
a

27
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:06,640
new,

28
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:06,920
happy

29
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:07,880
life.

30
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:08,000
So,

31
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,120
what

32
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:08,440
does

33
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:08,500
'abandon'

34
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:09,000
mean?

35
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,560
It's

36
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:09,640
a

37
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:09,880
verb

38
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:10,280
and

39
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:10,640
it's

40
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:10,880
about

41
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:11,400
leaving

42
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:11,560
or

43
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:11,840
giving

44
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:12,000
up

45
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
completely;

46
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,080
or

47
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:13,200
to

48
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:13,960
desert

49
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:14,080
or

50
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,120
forsake.

51
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:15,280
It’s

52
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,160
pronounced

53
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,280
'ABANDON.”

54
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:17,480
Let's

55
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:17,680
look

56
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:17,880
at

57
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:18,040
some

58
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,160
examples:

59
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:19,720
1)

60
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:19,960
They

61
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:20,160
had

62
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:20,200
to

63
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:20,560
abandon

64
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:20,560
the

65
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:20,880
car

66
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,040
when

67
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:21,040
it

68
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:21,240
broke

69
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,000
down.

70
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,840
2)

71
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:22,960
The

72
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:23,640
explorers

73
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:23,840
had

74
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:23,880
to

75
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:24,160
abandon

76
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:24,280
their

77
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:24,680
mission

78
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:24,720
due

79
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,040
to

80
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:25,360
harsh

81
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,040
conditions.

82
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,360
3)

83
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:27,720
Despite

84
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:28,520
challenges,

85
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:28,680
he

86
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,080
refused

87
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:29,320
to

88
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:29,720
abandon

89
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:29,880
his

90
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,280
pursuit

91
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:30,280
of

92
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:30,880
knowledge.

93
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:30,880
