00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:01,960
the

8
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:02,600
the

10
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,200
had

00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:05,040
seeking

17
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:05,480
refuge

18
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:05,560
on

a

island.

22
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,120
The

23
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:07,560
decision

24
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:07,720
to

29
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:09,320
was

30
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:09,600
made

31
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:09,760
due

32
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,040
to

00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:10,760
environmental

34
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:11,360
concerns,

35
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,120
prompting

36
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:12,160
the

37
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:12,800
construction

38
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:12,800
of

39
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:12,960
a

40

modern,

41
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,160

its

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,200
place.

46
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:16,680
So,

47
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:16,840
what

48
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:17,120
does

49
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:17,520
'abandon'

50
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,200
mean?

51
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:18,480
It's

52
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:18,680
a

53
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:18,840
verb

54
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:19,000
and

55
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,160
it's

56
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:19,400
about

57
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:19,840
leaving

58
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:20,080
or

59
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:20,360
giving

60
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:20,440
up

61
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,480
completely;

62
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:21,640
or

63
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:21,760
to

64
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,400
desert

65
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:22,560
or

66
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,600
forsake.

67
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:23,760
It’s

68
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,440
pronounced

69
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,360
'ABANDON.”

70
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:25,800
Repeat

71
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:25,960
after

72
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:26,200
me,

73
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:26,600
“ABANDON.”

74
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:26,960
Let's

75
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,520
look

76
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:27,680
at

77
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,040
some

78
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:28,800

79
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,760
1.

80
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:29,880
They

81
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,040
had

82
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:30,360

it

88
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:31,600
broke

89
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:31,920
down.

90
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,040
2.

91
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:33,240
The

92
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:33,840

93

to

100
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:35,760
harsh

101
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,480
conditions.

102
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,240
3.

103
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,000
Despite

104
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,760
challenges,

105
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,160
he

106
