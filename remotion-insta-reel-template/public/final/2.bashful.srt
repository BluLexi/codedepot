00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:02,800
Sarah

7
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:03,080
felt

8
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:03,480
bashful

9
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:03,840
when

10
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:04,160
everyone

11
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:04,640
clapped

12
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:04,800
after

13
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:05,040
her

14
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:05,440
piano

16
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:06,640
Her

17
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:06,960
cheeks

18
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:07,360
turned

19
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:07,360
pink

20
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:07,440
as

21
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:07,800
she

22
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:08,760
shyly

23
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:08,840
looked

24
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:09,320
down,

25
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,040
surprised

26
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:10,200
by

27
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:10,320
the

28
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,400
attention.

29
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:11,680
Being

30
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:12,120
bashful

31
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:12,360
didn't

32
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:12,720
stop

33
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:12,880
her

34
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,040
from

35
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:13,200
enjoying

36
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:13,520
the

37
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:13,720
warm

38
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,160
applause

39
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:14,640
and

40
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:14,720
the

41
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,200
sense

42
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:15,240
of

43
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:15,960
accomplishment.

44
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:16,360


45
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:16,640
So,

46
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:16,720
what

47
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:17,080
does

48
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:17,600
"bashful"

49
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,240
mean?

50
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:18,520
It's

51
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:18,680
an

52
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:19,280
adjective

53
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:19,480
and

54
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:19,680
it's

55
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:19,920
about

56
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,240
being

57
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:20,640
shy

58
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:20,840
or

59
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:21,400
easily

60
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:21,880
embarrassed,

61
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:22,240
often

62
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:22,320
in

63
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:22,680
social

64
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,920
situations.

65
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,080
It’s

66
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:24,680
pronounced

67
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:25,520
"BASHFUL.”

68
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:25,800
Repeat

69
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:25,960
after

70
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:25,960
me,

71
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:26,280
“BASHFUL.”

72
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:26,280


73
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:26,840
Let's

74
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,040
look

75
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:28,320
at

bashful

83
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:31,480
when
