00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:02,080
Sarah

7
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:02,400
felt

8
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:02,800
bashful

9
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:03,120
when

10
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:03,400
everyone

11
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:03,960
clapped

12
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:04,400
after

00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:04,720
her

14
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:04,840
piano

16
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:05,960
Her

17
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:06,240
cheeks

18
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:06,720
turned

19
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:06,920
pink

20
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:06,960
as

21
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:07,160
she

22
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,000
shyly

23
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,200
looked

24
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:08,520
down,

25
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:09,120
surprised

26
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:09,240
by

27
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:09,400
the

28
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,440
attention.

29
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:10,640
Being

30
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,040
bashful

31
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:11,400
didn't

32
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:11,680
stop

33
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:11,840
her

34
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:12,000
from

35
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,120
enjoying

36
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:12,480
the

37
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:12,880
warm

38
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,480
applause

39
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:13,880
and

40
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:13,880
the

41
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:14,080
sense

42
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:14,160
of

43
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:14,760
accomplishment.

44
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:15,520


45
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:15,720
So,

46
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:15,720
what

47
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,000
does

48
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,640
"bashful"

49
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:17,760
mean?

50
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:17,960
It's

51
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:18,120
an

52
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:18,840
adjective

53
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:19,000
and

54
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,200
it's

55
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:19,360
about

56
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:19,680
being

57
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,520
shy

58
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:20,720
or

59
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,240
easily

60
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,200
embarrassed,

61
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:22,480
often

62
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:22,680
in

63
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,080
social

64
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,240
situations.

65
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:24,440
It’s

66
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,040
pronounced

67
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,560
"BASHFUL.”

68
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:26,840
Repeat

69
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:27,120
after

70
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:27,240
me,

71
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,000
“BASHFUL.”

72
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,000


73
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,160
Let's

74
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:29,280
look

75
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:29,280
at
