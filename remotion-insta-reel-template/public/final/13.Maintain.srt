00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:00,880
word

3
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:01,040
is

4
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,200
"maintain."

5
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:02,200


6
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:02,520
Taking

7
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:03,120
necessary

8
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:03,400
steps

9
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:03,480
to

10
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:03,640
maintain

11
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:04,120
aspects

12
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:04,160
of

13
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:04,440
life

14
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:04,680
can

15
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:04,720
lead

16
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:05,160
to

17
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:05,640

21
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:07,680


22
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,080
So,

23
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:08,200
what

24
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:08,360
does

25
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:08,880
'maintain'

26
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:09,760
mean?

27
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,000
It's

28
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,240
a

29
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:10,480
verb,

30
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:10,640
indicating

31
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,120
the

32
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:11,440
action

33
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:11,560
to

34
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:11,840
keep

35
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:12,120
something

36
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:12,240
in

37
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:12,360
a

38
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:12,880

39
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,360

40
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:13,440

41
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,160
preserve

42
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:14,280
or

43
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,400
sustain.

44
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:15,520
Itâ€™s

45
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,000
pronounced

46
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,200
'MAINTAIN'.

47
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:17,200

Let's

49
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:17,800
