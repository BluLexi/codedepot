00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,600
Today,

2
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:00,760
our

3
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:01,000
word

4
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:01,160
is

5
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:02,240
"jealous."

6
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:02,240


7
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:02,560
Feeling

8
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:03,200
jealous,

9
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:03,360
she

10
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:03,640
couldn't

11
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:03,920
hide

12
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:04,160
her

13
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:04,520
envy

14
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:04,680
when

15
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:04,920
her

16
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:05,240
friend

17
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:05,680
received

18
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:05,720
a

19
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,120
promotion.

20
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:07,600
Jealousy

21
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:07,960
arises

22
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:08,200
from

23
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:08,280
the

24
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:08,560
fear

25
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:08,600
of

26
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,000
losing

27
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,240
what

28
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:09,480
others

29
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:10,800
have.

30
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,320
Overcoming

31
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:11,960
jealousy

32
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:12,600
requires

33
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,360
self-reflection

34
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:13,480
and

35
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,080
celebrating

36
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:14,440
others'

37
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:14,760
success

38
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:14,880
rather

39
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:15,040
than

40
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:15,680
resenting

41
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:15,840
it.

42
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:16,440


43
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:16,760
So,

44
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:16,880
what

45
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,120
does

46
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:17,520
'jealous'

47
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,600
mean?

48
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:18,880
It's

49
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:19,000
an

50
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,480
adjective,

51
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,120
describing

52
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:20,160
the

53
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:20,440
feeling

54
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:20,600
of

55
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,160
resentment

56
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:21,360
or

57
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:21,640
envy

58
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:21,880
towards

59
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:22,120
someone

60
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:22,560
else's

61
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,240
possessions,

62
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,320
qualities,

63
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:24,400
or

64
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,360
success.

65
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:25,560
Itâ€™s

66
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,200
pronounced

67
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,200
'JEALOUS.'

68
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:27,200


69
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:27,600
Let's

70
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,000
explore

71
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,240

72
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:28,560

jealous

77
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:30,560

79
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,080
