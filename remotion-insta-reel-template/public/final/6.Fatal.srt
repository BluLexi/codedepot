00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,200
Today,

2
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:00,520
our

3
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:00,840
focus

4
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:01,240
is

5
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:01,400
on

6
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:01,440
the

7
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:01,640
word

8
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:02,560
'fatal.'

9
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:02,560


10
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:02,640
The

11
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:02,960
doctor

12
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:03,040
delivered

13
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:03,280
the

14
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:03,520
news

15
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:03,880
with

16
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:04,040
a

17
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:04,360
heavy

18
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:04,920
heart,

19
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:05,320
knowing

20
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:05,320
that

21
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:05,440
the

22
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:05,880
patient's

23
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:06,240
condition

24
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:06,480
was

25
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,560
fatal.

26
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:07,920
Despite

27
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:08,080
the

28
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:08,360
fatal

29
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:09,080
outcome,

30
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:09,400
safety

31
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:09,760
measures

32
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:09,920
can

33
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:10,280
prevent

34
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:10,440
such

35
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,240
tragedies.

36
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:11,680


37
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:11,840
So,

38
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:12,040
what

39
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:12,280
does

40
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:12,600
'fatal'

41
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,200
mean?

42
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:13,520
It's

43
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:13,800
an

44
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,040
adjective

45
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:14,160
and

46
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:14,360
it's

47
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:14,640
about

48
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,240
resulting

49
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:15,240
in

50
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:15,520
death;

51
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,280
causing

52
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:16,720
ruin

53
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:17,160
or

54
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:17,440
failure.

55
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:17,520
Itâ€™s

56
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,160
pronounced

57
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:18,560
'FATAL.'

58
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:18,560


59
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,360
Let's

60
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:19,840
explore

61
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:20,120
some

62
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,120
examples:

63
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:21,480
1)

64
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,520
Seat

65
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:22,840
belts

66
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:22,960
can

67
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:23,360
prevent

68
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:23,800
fatal

69
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,200
injuries

70
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:24,320
in

71
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:24,320

73
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,200
accident.

74
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,280
2)

75
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:26,600
The

76
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,040
disease

77
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:27,280
has

78
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:27,520

79
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:27,600

82
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:28,680
and

83
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,000
treatment

84
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,800
options

85
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:29,960
are

86
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:30,240
limited.

87
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,400
3)

88
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:31,680
The

89
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,280

90
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:32,560

91
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,040
proved

92
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:33,680
fatal,

93
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:33,920
leading

94
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:34,120
to

95
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:34,120

99
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:35,640
